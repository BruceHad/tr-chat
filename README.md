(Learning Project)

The Skill-Sharing website is a project at the end of the [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/21_skillsharing.html) book.

**[Demo](https://radiant-dawn-92007.herokuapp.com/)**

This page implements all the required features of the website, but uses the Express framework and various other Node tools, rather than the custom code provided in the book.

Feature description:

* Holds a list of Talk proposals along with Comments associated with each proposal.
* Allows user to add, update and delete proposals and comments.
* Updates some pages in real-time* whenever any data is updated.

The design tries to follow Progress Enhancement principles and the basic features should work with Javascript disabled.
